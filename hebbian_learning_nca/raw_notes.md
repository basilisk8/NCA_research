 - NCA are local
 - brain is local
 - brain uses hebbian learning (and maybe smt more) to learn
 - can NCA's be trained to memorize something just purely hebbian learning, no backprop or chain rule to modify weights with calc

 - experiment failed
 - my guess is because firstly per cell weight is an unstable architecture
 - second reason it because convulution has 1 weights for everything, so less parameters than every cell having it's own weight, so computationally convulution is faster
 - third reason hebbian learning is not the only learning algorithm the brain uses, so we can't train a NCA liek the brain learns without knowing exactly how the brain learns
